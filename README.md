# HTML-word-scramble-game
Word scramble is a game where the letters that can make a meaningful word are shuffled or scrambled randomly, and players have to find out the correct word using those random letters.
In this game there is a hint too that helps the user to find the correct word easily. Players have to find the correct word in the given time which is 30 seconds. If the current word is difficult to find there is a refresh button to get a new word.
